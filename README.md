# The Odin Project: Recipe Project

## Overview
This project is a part of the curriculum for The Odin Project. It's primarily an HTML project where I've created a simple website to share some of my favorite recipes.

## Recipes Included
1. **Torta Milanesa**: A delicious and hearty sandwich from Argentina, loaded with breaded meat, cheese, and a variety of toppings.
2. **Tuna and Corn Salad**: A light and refreshing salad, perfect for a quick lunch or a side dish.
3. **Lasagna**: A classic Italian dish with layers of pasta, cheese, and tomato sauce, baked to perfection.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5

## Project Status
This project is currently complete as per The Odin Project's requirements. I might update it in the future with more recipes and possibly incorporate CSS for better styling.
